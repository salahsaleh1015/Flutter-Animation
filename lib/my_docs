what is an animation in flutter ?
it is a series of images or frames that changes at a period of time.
//========
what is a main keys to do animation in flutter?
1- Animation Controller : responsible for control the animation
2- Animation: the value that changed within the animation
3- Tween: the range of Values from start point in animation to end point
4- Foo Widget / Foo Transition Widget: Built in widgets support animation in flutter
5- Animated Builder: widget get the developer an animation controller to do a unique animation.

//============

what are the main concepts of the animation in flutter ?
1- Duration : it is the period of time while the animation finished,
2- Curve:(animation behavior) a mathematical equations that control the duration progress
3- interpolation: used to make a smooth animation in flutter

//=============
what is the types of animation in flutter ?
1- Implicit Animation: most easy way to do animation no need to control but you cant customize your animation
2- Explicit Animation: more complex than the Implicit you need to control the animation but more customizable
3- Low Level Animation: you create it and control it (custom painter)
4- third party framework: put and go ( lottie animation )

Animation Controller:
Control (start – progress – end)
Need (Duration - vsync)
Function animation (Controller.forward(); - Controller.reverse(); - Controller.dispose();)


Animation Controller Properties:
1-	Status
2-	Value
3-	listeners

Animation Controller Status:
 animationStatus.forward(); from 0.0 to 1.0
animationStatus.reverse(); from 1.0 to 0.0
animationStatus.completed(); the value of animation is 1.0
animationStatus.dissmised(); the value of animation is 0.0


Animation Controller Listeners:
1-	_animationController.addListeners(){}

2-	_animationController.removeListeners(){}

 Animation Controller Value:
From 0.0 To 1.0
Example   the animation is from 50 t0 100
So 0.0 = 50 & 1.0 = 100




VSYNC:
Stand for => Vertical Synchronization
Used to Estimate the Refresh Rate of The Screen
Note: Each Screen have it’s Own Refresh Rate so we use (vsync:this)

VSYNC Types:
1-	Single Ticker Provider => for single animation
2-	Ticker Provider => for multi Animation


Animation Builder Types:

1-	Animated builder
2-	Tween Animation builder
3-	Page Route Builder
4-	Transition Builder
